# BreakBuddy Changelog
All notable changes to BreakBuddy will be documented in this file.

### *Planned Future Developments*
* Support for ends of breaks.
* Pull shift details from Replicon or somewhere else, so that users shift is selected automatically.
  * This might be trickier than I initially thought. If you have any ideas, I'm open to hearing them.
