# BreakBuddy Changelog
All notable changes to BreakBuddy will be documented in this file.

### *Requirements for Version 1.0*

* Remember local settings.
* Adding patch numbers to the main screen.
  * Patches will be released if break times change. Having something visible on the main screen will make it easier to quickly tell which one is being used.
* Support for ends of breaks.

### *Planned Future Developments*
* Pull shift details from Replicon or somewhere else, so that users shift is selected automatically.
  * This might be trickier than I initially thought. If you have any ideas, I'm open to hearing them.
